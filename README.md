# SOLID Design Principles

## S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The single responsibility principle states that **every Java class must perform a single functionality.**
Implementation of multiple functionalities in a single class mashup the code.

## O : Open closed Principle (OSP)

The open-closed principle states that according to new requirements the module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## L : Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)

It applies to inheritance in such a way that the **derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes.**
In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with aA without interrupting the behaviour of the program.

## I : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)



## D : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
